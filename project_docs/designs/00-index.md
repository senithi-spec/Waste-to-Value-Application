# Designs - Waste-to-Value

This folder contains architecture and UX design artifacts.

Files:
- 01-use-case-diagram.md
- 02-class-diagram.md
- 03-sequence-diagrams.md
- 04-activity-diagrams.md
- 05-component-diagram.md

Tips: Each design file includes a mermaid placeholder so you can quickly render diagrams in markdown viewers that support mermaid, or use draw.io/diagrams.net for visual editing.
