# 07 - Metrics & KPIs

Trackable metrics for Waste-to-Value:

- Active Users (DAU/MAU)
- Number of Listings Created (daily/weekly)
- Request Conversion Rate (requests → approvals)
- Time-to-Match (from listing to approved request)
- Successful Transfers / Completions
- Average response time for API endpoints
- Error rate (5xx) and frontend JS errors

Use these to prioritize improvements and iteratively increase platform value.
