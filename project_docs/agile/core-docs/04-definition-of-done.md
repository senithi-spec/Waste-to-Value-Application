# 04 - Definition of Done (DoD)

A backlog item is "Done" when:
- Code is implemented and reviewed (PR merged)
- Unit and integration tests added and passing
- Feature is deployed to a test environment
- Documentation updated (README, API docs, user docs)
- No critical bugs are open for the feature

Release DoD:
- All sprint stories marked 'Done'
- Smoke-tested release (basic end-to-end flow)
- Migration scripts applied and verified
