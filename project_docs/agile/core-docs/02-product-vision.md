# 02 - Product Vision

Waste-to-Value will be the leading platform that connects waste generators with collectors and recyclers to turn waste into usable resources, reducing landfill usage and creating economic value.

Key goals:
- Reduce waste sent to landfills by enabling easy discovery and transfer of recyclable materials.
- Enable transparent, role-based workflows (generator -> collector -> recycler).
- Provide fast, trustable matching and tracking for waste items.
- Offer a minimal, maintainable MVP that can be expanded to include payments and analytics.
