# 06 - MRF Definition

MRF in this project stands for *Minimum Releasable Feature* (feature set small enough to ship and provide value). The MRF defines the smallest scope that, when delivered, provides meaningful outcomes for early users.

For Waste-to-Value the MRF set includes:
- Registration and login
- Create/list/search waste items
- Request and basic approval flow
- Real-time listing updates and notifications
- Seeded users and an initial dataset

Use MRF to scope early releases and experiments.
