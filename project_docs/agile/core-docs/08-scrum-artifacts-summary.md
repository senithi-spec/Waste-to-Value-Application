# 08 - Scrum Artifacts Summary

- **Product Backlog**: Prioritized list of features (see `03-product-backlog.md`).
- **Sprint Backlog**: Commitments for the current sprint (create per-sprint docs under `sprints/`).
- **Increment**: The potentially shippable product after each sprint.
- **Definition of Done**: See `04-definition-of-done.md`.

Suggested cadence:
- 2-week sprints
- Sprint planning, daily standup, review, retrospective

Templates for sprints should be created in `project_docs/agile/sprints/` (e.g., `sprint-01.md`).
